    <h1>Doge's Academy for Superheroes is calling! We need more heroes!</h1>

    <p>Our school motto:</p>
    <h2>Your powers are not what make you special, you are!</h2>

    <p>Yes, we realize that we sound like we're advertizing when we say that, but
        it is true that this world needs more heroes! We must be the barrier that protects others from those that wish them harm! I'm not saying that there are just tons of people waiting to become supervillains, but there are some out there, and those are who we protect against.
    </p>
    <p>
        We are the school where, if you wish, you can become one who helps others as well as yourself, provide a benefit to the world. Or you can use us as a springboard to help promote yourself without doing any work and choosing not to help others, in which case we will persecute you, as we do not like being used for something other than our mission, which is to help others though our special abilities, our superpowers. Please join us as
        we do our best to make this world a better place here at DAS!
    </p>
