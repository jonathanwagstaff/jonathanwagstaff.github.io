        Welcome to Doge's Academy for Superheroes! we are confirmed as the best superschool in the world, with several different programs, each for different kinds of powers. We are on-campus only(because our campus is on a floating island over the ocean.), but we do have dormitories with deluxe options available for those who desire deluxe quarters(But they do cost extra because it takes money to run a school on a floating chunk of earth!).
