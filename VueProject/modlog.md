    I already partially setup the files and Vue getup before today, but forgot to make a log and record it. But anyway, I now have decided that I am going to make this page a SPA, and am going to make it DOGE themed as usual, unsure about what yet though. Right now, all I am doing is building the outline to build off of.
        Updated the modification log.

    I added the headings for the different sections while also figuring out what they were. I have chosen a SPA style application.

    I started the template for the events as well as adjusted it to be on the right side, like a lot of club pages. I also am planning to put pictures for the Overseers section, and a form for the Starting a Club section. I also need to figure out how to hide and un-hide the different club descriptions, and improve the nav section. I am now trying to make the nave better, but it isn't working because "space-around" is deciding to act like "center". I also tried working with vue for a while, but it just doesn't seem to work. I tried the CDN, and then the terminal, and then the official extension on VSCode. None of it has worked, and although I know this is a Vue project, it just isn't working, so I am just going to build the project and get what score I can. Sorry. I have now improved the nav and events, and am going to do the form as the last part. I am not the best at validation, so I will likely just use the automatic HTML validating so I can get this done. I am done with what I am doing to to the form, and I think the website, outside of the modification log. I am now going to be done with this, but again, sorry for not using vue, I really tried. But thank you for this great semester, I enjoyed having you as a teacher.
        Updated the CSS.
