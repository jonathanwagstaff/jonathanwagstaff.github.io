        <h2>Our Ideals</h2>
          <h3>We are Honorable</h3>
          <p>We honor our school and each other. That is part of the agreement you make when you become part of DAS. That doesn't mean that you have to agree with everyone or like them or even interact with them. It means that you agree to not sneak attack someone if you don't like them, instead challenging them openly to their face, and then fighting them or sneak attacking them or shaming them, whichever you prefer. Although not during class hours and intentional deaths are absolutely prohibited, with a possible punishment of being expelled, depending on whether they live or not.</p>

          <h3>We are Earnest</h3>
          <p>This means not making a promise and then purposely breaking it. If you make a promise, it is now your duty to fulfill that promise to the best of your abilities. I mean, there are special occasions with supervillains and the type, but they are far and few between and what you do then is up to you and what you truly believe to be right. Always make your promises carefully, so they mean something, the right thing.</p>

          <h3>We are Ready</h3>
          <p>No, that doesn't mean that you can't have any personal time off or that you can't sleep, but it means that you will be there if you feel the need. We are ready to help others, which means that you will be there when you can. That doesn't mean that you will always be on time, sadly, but it means that you do your best to be ready for when the time does come that you are needed.</p>

          <h3>We are Original</h3>
          <p>Being original is a important part of our ideals. Starting with even our staff, we are a group of very unique people. We have a dog for a principal, Birdman and our combat mentor (<strong>never</strong> call him a clown!) for teachers, and some of the most unique students in the world!(Some may even not be fully human anymore, but please don't say that to their  face.)</p>

          <h3>We are Eager</h3>
          <p>If you signed up with us, you should <i>want</i> to help others, to be there to help. That certainly doesn't mean that you will always be happy to help, or want to all of the time, but what it means is that you generally want to help others in your own way, no matter what it is.</p>

          <h3>We are Super</h3>
          <p>We are those with superpowers. That make us different from others, makes us more able to help. Please, I implore you, use your powers for good, and to help others, instead of just for selfish reasons. This world already has enough of those, please, be the light.</p>

          <h3>We are HEROES</h3>
          <p>We are <strong>Heroes</strong>. Heroes aren't only those qualities that are on this page, they are those that try their very hardest to be good to to be the good in the world. They are those who are even willing to <i>try</i>. Please, be one of the heroes in this world. That is what we teach, we teach how you can become a hero. Please, learn how to a light, no matter who you are!</p>
