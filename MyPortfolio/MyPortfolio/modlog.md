    I made the html files and other folders so far, and I am planning to base this off of my old portfolio to simplify things, but also to make it different, because of Javascript. I also gave boilerplate to the html.
        Updated CSS and Javascript files.

    I added an extra page to the site, as well as finished up the boilerplate for the html and did the body and nav sections for the css for as far as I can tell. I also created content in my index.html page, and have started on the footer, linking to Github and LinkedIn. I finished the form for the contact page, having used one a lot like the one in my old portfolio, although with different styling.
        Updated CSS.
