<!-- Jonny Wagstaff 2/20/2025 landing page/main website
     Added a button to the landing page that moves the user to the home page of the website instead of a repeating prompt as that could annoy users having it repeatably show up. Also caused the button to be on a timer so it's only able to be clicked after two minutes. Added a <p> element that told the user that they couldn't use the button yet. Modified the relevant Javascript.
          Done.To do: Add carousal to the faculty page and add form to the contact page. Also add navigation bar to main website.
               Updated the modification log.

<!-- Jonny Wagstaff 2/21/2025 landing page/main website
     I made it to where the <p> element becomes hidden when the button becomes activated, and also made a alert to be sent out notifying the user that they can click the button. 
     Also added the navigation bar. Also changed the faculty page into a graduated students page instead and made my image carousal there. I also made a form on the contact page, it doesn't look fancy, I am making this to work right now, then adding looks later.
     Updated the relevant CSS and Javascript.
          To do: Add more images to the top students page as well as a short description for each one. Also add Javascript to form to actually submit it and make it look better. Also make the user able to hide navigation bar.
               Updated the modification log.

<!-- Jonny Wagstaff 2/22/2025 main website: contact page
     I worked on the navigation bar and made it hidable. I also finished adding CSS and Javascript to my form, hopefully making it to where it will send the form to my actual email when the form is submitted. also added validation for the email address and phone number.
          Updated the modification log.
