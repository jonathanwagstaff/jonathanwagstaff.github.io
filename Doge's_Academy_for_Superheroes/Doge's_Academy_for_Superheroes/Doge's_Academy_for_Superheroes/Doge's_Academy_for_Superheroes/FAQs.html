   <p>Here are some of the most frequently asked questions. these ones were selected from a Q&A interview with Doge, the principal.</p>

    <main>
       <div id="accordion">
            <h3>What if I have a useless power?</h3>
            <div><p>You say that as if there is such a thing! You give me a example of what exactly you mean by "useless power", and I promise you I will find a use for it! While it is true that some superpowers are useful in more circumstances than others, every power is useful in it's own way. Also, as long as you compare your powers against others, you will unlock less potential than you could simply striving to do your best. Besides, remember our motto, your powers are not what make you special, you are!</p></div>

            <h3>Who is your favorite student that you have taught?</h3>
            <div><p>Wow, you just went directly to personal questions, huh? You know that if I truthfully answer that, I will break the hearts of all of my other students, right? Oh, you do? Well, that's kinda disturbing, but fine, I'll answer your query. My favorite student that I have taught would be ######. Oh, you couldn't catch that? Well guess what, that's because it's restricted. Yes, superpowers caused it to where you couldn't hear it. Just know, he probably won't be happy if anyone finds out, so don't be too nosy. Nex question!</p></div>

            <h3>Are the fights at DAS lethal, particularly at events?</h3>
            <div><p>No, of course not! The students are very well protected, with special staff on standby to teleport students in danger out of fights, along with healing experts who can heal pretty much any kind of wound. To be fair though that's only at events and class activities, during offsides fights it's harder to monitor, but we still have medical care and teleporters stationed around the school just in case, even with a couple of revivers at the medical center.</p></div>

            <h3>Is the dog at events the principal's pet?</h3>
            <div><p>No! I am the principal! I have repeatably said that on the events that you just mentioned! Can people please stop thinking I am a pet when I am the principal! My superpower is superintelligence and a modified voicebox so I can speak human, so I decided to start a school! Why do you ask this so much, why! (This is the point where the Q&A session ended, because the principal started sobbing and stumbled off the podium into the side wings.)</p></div>
