        Roles are the overreaching archetypes of both powers and team positions. That doesn't mean that anyone has to have assigned roles, or have one of each in a party and it can't be any other way. No, these roles are to simply help people narrow down what they do in battle, so you have a basic understanding of each other. But each team is different, and they all should be what they believe is best, no matter what "optimization experts" say. We have a motto here at Doge's Academy for Superheroes, and that is:
      </p>

      <div id="accordion">
        <h3>Caster</h3>
        <div><p>Casters are the role of those who's superpowers allow them to attack from afar, such as those with elemental powers. They may attack, disable, defend, or something else that doesn't quite fit into any of those categories. The main point of a caster is they attack from afar. They may sometimes get up close and personal, or even be the tank of the team or the skirmisher, but most of the time they will be on the backlines of the field.</p></div>

        <h3>DPS</h3>
        <div><p>DPS, or Damage Per Second, are the role of those who's powers allow them to attack a lot and hard, whether from up close or afar. This means that someone can qualify as a tank AND DPS, or mage AND DPS. You can often do either one, but DPS is best if you mostly attack and don't defend as much as a tank, or be as diverse as a caster. DPS roles are not necessarily the people who hit the hardest, but they are usually the person to go to in order to get the most damage possible.</p></div>

        <h3>Miscellaneous</h3>
        <div><p>These are the people with powers or depositions that don't quite fit into any of the other categories. Like, you may be a ranged caster that prefers to do melee. Or you may be a DPS that likes to support, or you may just be someone who can do things such as make rubber balls out of nowhere. This is the biggest range of powers, and it's not unusual for almost every team to have at least one miscellaneous person on their team, often giving that bit of unpredictability needed in any good team.</p></div>

        <h3>Support</h3>
        <div><p>Support is one of the most important roles a superhero can have. They are what keeps the team going past what is otherwise possible, other than inspiration, of course. Some teams will actually be mostly support, with one or two people that they just insanely buff. But anyway, supporters are one of the most important people on a team, and don't you let anyone tell you that you are a background person! You are a person same as anyone else, and you do not have to be in the background to show it!</p></div>

        <h3>Skirmisher</h3>
        <div><p>Skirmishers are an interesting part of all teams. They are often, but not always, the first engagers. They go in quickly, attack strong, and get out. They then often look for opportunities for chances to go back in and hit quickly, then get out. Those that are called assassins can often be put under the role skirmisher, along with speedsters. Being a skirmisher, as usual, doesn't mean that you need to get in and get out. You are your person, you decide your path.</p></div>

        <h3>Tank</h3>
        <div><p>The tank of the team is the one who can take hits that others can't necessarily take. They are there so they can soak up damage so others have the opportunity to do what they need to. In a way, a tank is a kind of support unit in of themselves. But no way should that limit the possibilities you can achieve! Tanks are not only known for their ability to soak up damage, but also to dish it out. All of them are different though, with some even having what are typically caster abilities, such as water manipulation.</p></div>
      </div>
