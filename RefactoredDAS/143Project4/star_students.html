    <p id="Tai">Name: Tai<br>Age: 25<br>Mini bio: He has the power to "hulk out", becoming much stronger and tougher, along with uncontrollably furious at anything that may or may not be moving in the process. He isn't that intelligent, but he makes does with what he has. It's a plus that he's loyal.</p>

    <p id="Lily" hidden>Name: Lily<br>Age: 22<br>Mini bio: She has the power to turn into animals, and has recently unlocked the power to turn partially. She has a pet squirrel that goes with her pretty much everywhere and she <strong>loves</strong> soda. She somehow drinks roughly 20 gallons of it a day, yet doesn't die from too much liquid.</p>

    <p id="Kai" hidden>Name: Kai<br>Age: 23<br>Mini bio: He has the power to animate objects, along with sometimes making them able to float, as you can see. He is a roguish fellow, who as his roommate, Swordedger, likes to say it, "He repeatably steals my stuff, including trying to steal my swords. I then beat him up or my swords do, and the cycle repeats.". He does have his virtues though, he will try to <i>mostly</i> steal from the bad guys.</p>

    <p id="Swordedger" hidden>Name: Swordedger(Well, not actually, but it's what he goes by. His past and all that.)<br>Age: 17<br>Mini bio: He has the power to control "weapons", which really includes mostly anything used in combat, even including grappling hooks. He is a very skilled fighter, who according to him was taught by his grandfather. We would like to know who his grandpa is, but he seems to have disappeared, not dead as Swordedger first believed. But anyway, Swordedger himself is young man to go to Doge's Academy, but he's a good boy.</p>
