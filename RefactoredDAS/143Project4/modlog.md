    I copied all of the files from my SWDV 140 into this folder, and then I adjusted them to not include jQuery, and to include Bootstrap instead. I also changed the pathways so they used Javascript instead of Typescript for a folder. I started working on getting the accordion on the home page working again, and will continue tomorrow. I also changed some of the format of text on the roles.html page, and started updating the contact form to Bootstrap, and I may have finished, not sure yet.
        To do: Finish accordion, and maybe one or two other things, along with a few text and content changes.
            Updated CSS and Javascript.
                Updated the modification log.

    Today I finished the form up a bit, as well as looked up how to give feedback after submitting and used some code I found online and used a Bootstrap toast to help. I also got commented out most of the Javascript code for contact.js, only using what I needed. I also finished the accordion on the home page, so I think I'm all done with this project. Thank you for your help today and for this semester, Rick!
