        Welcome to Doge's Academy for Superheroes! we are confirmed as the best superschool in the world, with several different programs, each for different kinds of powers. We are on-campus only(because our campus is on a floating island over the ocean.), but we do have dormitories with deluxe options available for those who desire deluxe quarters(But they do cost extra because it takes money to run a school on a floating chunk of earth!).

This tournament is often used as a good way to gain recognition for students, with those that win both gaining prizes and later employment opportunities as nearly all of the top companies in the world use this tournament to as a sort of interview for possible employees. You better bring your A-game if you want a chance of winning!</p>

No warning, no rules(except for no deaths), just Go Go Go!</p>

      <h3>Student Clubs Creation and Registration Day</h3>
      <p>Where: Main Hall<br>When: 10am-7pm, October 10<br>Description: The day that students can register for clubs, or create their own if they wish. The existing clubs will have booths in the Main Hall so come and participate if you can! Anyone wanting to make their own club will have to have at least 5 members and get permission from Birdman in order to create a club, as well as figure out all the nances such as location and time.</p>
