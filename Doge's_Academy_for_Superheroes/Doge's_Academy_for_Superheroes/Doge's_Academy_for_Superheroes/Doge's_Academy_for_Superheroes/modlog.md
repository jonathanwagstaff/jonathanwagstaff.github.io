<!-- Jonny Wagstaff 2/20/2025 landing page/main website
     Added a button to the landing page that moves the user to the home page of the website instead of a repeating prompt as that could annoy users having it repeatably show up. Also caused the button to be on a timer so it's only able to be clicked after two minutes. Added a <p> element that told the user that they couldn't use the button yet. Modified the relevant Javascript.
          Done.To do: Add carousel to the faculty page and add form to the contact page. Also add navigation bar to main website.
               Updated the modification log.

<!-- Jonny Wagstaff 2/21/2025 landing page/main website
     I made it to where the <p> element becomes hidden when the button becomes activated, and also made a alert to be sent out notifying the user that they can click the button. 
     Also added the navigation bar. Also changed the faculty page into a graduated students page instead and made my image carousal there. I also made a form on the contact page, it doesn't look fancy, I am making this to work right now, then adding looks later.
     Updated the relevant CSS and Javascript.
          To do:
               Done.Also add Javascript to form to actually submit it and make it look better. Also make the user able to hide navigation bar. Add more images to the top students page as well as a short description for each one. 
                    Updated the modification log.

<!-- Jonny Wagstaff 2/22/2025 main website: contact page
     I worked on the navigation bar and made it hidable. I also finished adding CSS and Javascript to my form. also added validation for the email address and phone number. Also made it to where you can completely hide the navigation bar, with no background left. Cleaned up a bit up code that was unneeded on the landing page. Updated the relevant CSS and Javascript.
          To do: design the look of the contact form better and submit it to my actual email.
               Done: Next page to add is Home page.

<!-- Jonny Wagstaff 2/28/2025 main website: Javascript/Typescript
     I added extra Javascript files in case of a emergency, as well as turned the original Javascript files into Typescript and modifying the files and file names. I also took the HTML files out of their folder, and renamed home_page.html into index.html, according to common practice. I took the errors out of my typescript, but have yet to get them working to their full functionality again. I also have added to the home page, adding some introductory text and what's going to be the heading for school events. I already have some events in mind, but the events aside is a work-in-progress. Updated the relevant CSS and Javascript/Typescript files.
          To do:
               Done: Next page to add is the Programs page.
               Updated the modification log. Add more to the home page and the events aside, and think of more features to add to the page. Also add photos to raise interest.
                    Updated the modification log.

     I added a bit of framework to most of the rest of the pages, and downloaded the accordion and tabs jQueryui widgets,and added the accordion widget onto the FAQs.html page. I also added more content onto the about_us.html page. Added more photos to the student_images folder to put in the star_students.html page.
          Done: As well as add accordion to programs and tabs to the navigation bar and add more students to the star_students.html page. figure out how to make the events bar in the home page.

                    Updated the modification log.

<!-- Jonny Wagstaff 3/7/2025 Main website
     I added more content to FAQs.html, about_us.html, programs.html, and student_help.html pages, and got the jQueryui widgets to work, I also added RegEx to my contact.html page and modified the relevant Typescript page to validate through that.
          Fixed: The navigation bar will no longer hide or show, the star_students carousel will no longer show up either, the accordion on the FAQs.html and programs.html pages covers the entire width including part of the navigation bar.
               Bugs/Problems: The contact form is not validating. My website is (no longer) starting to falling apart. 
                    To do: Fix bugs. Add more visual design. Add <p> tag content. In that order.(This is not all I have to do, but they are the priorities.)
                         Updated the modification log.

<!-- Jonny Wagstaff 3/8/2025 Main Website/Landing page
     I fixed most of the bugs from yesterday, which most of them were because the Typescript/Javascript weren't connecting to the HTML, which seemed to work better when I moved back onto Visual Studio Code, which TypeScript now works on. I also created JavaScript files from the Typescript and attached the html to those instead. Also changed the navigation bar to a horizontal bar at the top and it no longer is interfered with by the accordions. I also removed the unnecessary code and extra JavaScript files.
          Updated relevant TypeScript/JavaScript and CSS.
               Done: Fix the events aside, along with the photos on the home page.
                    To Do: Fix the form and add the <p> tags.
                         Updated the modification log.

<!-- Jonny Wagstaff 3/10-11/2025 Main website
     I added a automated carousel on the home page about the faculty and am probably going to take the one in the landing page off. I also fixed a couple bugs that had popped up or had not been saved correctly. Fixed the event aside and changed the formatting on the  home page.
          Updated relevant Typescript/Javascript and CSS.
               To Do: Couldn't think of anything new to add.
                    Updated the modification log.

<!--Jonny Wagstaff 3/12/2025 Main website and landing page
     I restyled the landing page a bit better, along with getting the link to work again. I also added Birdman to the faculty carousel and added events to the events, finishing my home page I believe. Also added more content to the Programs page. It is later in the day, and I have now finished my now-renamed roles.html page.
          Updated relevant Javascript and CSS.
               To do: Finish the rest of the pages, which is a lot, although the Student help page doesn't need much, I think.
                    Updated the modification log.

<!--Jonny Wagstaff 3/13/2025 Main website and landing page
     I finished the landing page, as well as the student help page. Added pretend links to the student help page, as well as CSS from the internet to disable them, as well as a heading informing users that the link don't currently work. I also completed the FAQs page.
          Updated the relevant Javascript and CSS.
               To do: Finish the last three pages, all of which will probably be harder than the others, although I have a few ideas.
                    Updated the modification log.

<!-- Jonny Wagstaff 3/14/2025 Main website
     I finished the newly renamed mission.html page and added the Swordedger photo to the star students page, as well as took out the photo of Tai raging. I completed the star students page. Sadly, I didn't manage to finish debugging my contact us page, but overall I am satisfied with how my website turned out. Thank you for teaching me how to do this, Rick.
          Updated the relevant Javascript.
               To do: Nothing should be left.
