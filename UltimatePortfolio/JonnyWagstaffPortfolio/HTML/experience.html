        <p>This is a assignment for my SWDV 115 class. It came a bit later in the class, when we were just learning how to use HTML/CSS forms.</p>
        <p id="Science">This is an image to represent the high school science class I am also taking. Though this is not a assigned piece of schoolwork, it is still a formula that I thought was important to include.</p>
        <p id="Admission">Admission is a assignment that I received for my SWDV 105 class, a few separate times actually. The point of the program was to determine whether or not a student got accepted into a program of some sort, I think a collage.</p>
