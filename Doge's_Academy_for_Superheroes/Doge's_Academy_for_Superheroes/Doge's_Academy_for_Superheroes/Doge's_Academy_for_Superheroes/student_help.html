          If you are a student here at DAS and you are having problems with studies/ahem "practical applications", we have several resources available to help you. Remember, we want you to succeed! We want you to succeed so that you can later help others who also need it in this world. Our services includes helpful sources for both common topics such as math, science, and the like. We also have resources to help with our specialty, superpowers.
        </p>
          
        <!--Just so anyone reading this knows, most of these links don't go anywhere and will be disabled.-->
        <p>
          We have tutoring available for both studies and superpower training. Remember, going to a tutor doesn't mean you are a problem, it means you have a problem. we also have resources such as whole libraries full of books and selected videos to help you understand the material taught in this school.
        </p>

          Our teachers are also willing to help students to succeed in their classes, you just need to ask them in a available time, such as right before or after class. There is also fellow students to reach out for help. If you don't understand how to use your powers quite the way you want to and don't want to go a tutor because everyone says "It isn't cool", you could ask other students for help, especially those of a older year, as they may have advice for you from their own experiences.

          If you don't like the option of asking someone straight out, we have a online hub for that reason. You don't have any automatic username that shows up when you use the chat, but you could add one into your text, if you really want to. This chat is only meant for academic purposes, with other options for socializing. Also, please be aware that the faculty can see who is texting what, so please be respectful of others on the chain.
